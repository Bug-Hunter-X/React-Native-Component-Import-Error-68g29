This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: an incorrect import statement leading to a 'Component not found' error. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from improperly importing a named export. The solution shows the proper way to import named components using curly braces. This is a frequent issue for developers new to React Native.
